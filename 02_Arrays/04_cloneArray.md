ğŸ”¹ What is the Spread Operator (...) in JavaScript?
The spread operator (...) is used to expand elements of an array, object, or string into individual elements.

ğŸ“Œ It helps copy, merge, and manipulate arrays and objects easily.
âœ… 1. Spread Operator with Arrays
ğŸ”¸ Example: Copying an Array
Instead of using .slice() to copy an array, you can use ...:

let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [...arr1];  // Copy arr1 into arr2

console.log(arr2);  // Output: [1, 2, 3]
ğŸ”¹ Why use ...? It creates a new copy instead of modifying the original array.

ğŸ”¸ Example: Merging Arrays

let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

let mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(mergedArray);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
ğŸ”¹ Easier than using .concat().

ğŸ”¸ Example: Adding Elements Easily
let numbers = [2, 3, 4];
let newNumbers = [1, ...numbers, 5];

console.log(newNumbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ğŸ”¹ You can insert elements anywhere in the array.
